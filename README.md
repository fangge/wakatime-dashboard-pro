## Background

This project is based on this [superman66 - wakatime-dashboard](https://github.com/superman66/wakatime-dashboard) inspiration. Big thx again. But the orgin repo can't meet my needs. So I willing to rebuild the project, analysis the data from [wakatime-api](https://wakatime.com/developers) and make them more clear to the user. Welcome to fork this project and contribute to it.
